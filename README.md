SAS programs for financial analysis

The SAS programs I used my Advanced Data Science in Finance at the Monroe College.

This is data analysis on finance. With the daily business activities of the enterprise, all kinds of data are inevitably generated within the enterprise. SAS is one of the leading enterprise tools in the world today when it comes to data management and analysis. It allows for faster, easier processing of data and empowers us to get valuable business insights for effective decision-making. How to use these data to draw useful insights and support our next product iteration and leadership decision-making is particularly important.
SAS helps to reduce the risk. 

SAS helps to improve customer relationships and enhance the customer experience to restore consumer/market confidence. SAS helps to reduce operational losses and combat financial crime to accurately provision capital and ensure customer confidence
